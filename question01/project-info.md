The database itself should be created to be located in the project root, in the file `animals-database.db`. When you open this project on your machine, you must create the file yourself. You can create it in the database browser or alternatively it should be created when you run the project for the first time. Once created, you may open this file in the SQLite DB Browser tool to examine its contents. The SQL script used to create the tables in this database is located in `sql/ANIMAL_DATA.sql`.

Within the `modules` directory, `database.js` contains a simple module which connects to the database, and exports a *promise*. The `sqlite.open` function is `async`, because opening a database is an operation which may take some time. Later on in our code, when we want to *use* the database, we can `await` the promise that's been exported here, in order to wait until the database has been properly opened.

The `database.js` module is itself used within the `animals-dao.js` module. This module will contain all the code which interacts with the database. Our code, organized in this way, follows the *Data Access Object (DAO)* pattern. The database access code is contained within a small subset of the program (in this case, just the `animals-dao` module).
